Lotto project predictor

1. How would this project work or flow? I've also done my own features but can advise best way to achieve this project.
2. What will I learn and best tools to use, is this intermediate project?
3. Features of project: 
	- retrieve past/historical data from Ithuba or valid source.
	- Once retrieved we load and clean the data using. Using python's built in csv or pandas. 
	- Store the drawn numbers for analysis
			- Now we analyze the patterns and draw numbers at random.
			- Count how often each number appears (frequent analysis)
			- Determine the "hot" (most frequent), "mild" (occasional/periodically) ( and "cold" (least frequent)
			- Track pair/triples that appear together often
	- Generate the predicitions:
			- From the hot and cold numbers drawn the most drawn "hot" or predicted numbers
			
	- Output optionally from two factors, for visual it's the front end or pritnting the results in the console.
	
	
	FLOW OF PROJECT
	
	Is the analysis logic (step 3) and predicition logic (step 4) two seperate. 
	For example in my script am I going to have teh below list of functions
	
-	dataProcessing function
-	analyzePatterns function
-	generatePredictions
-	results function

phase 1: 
- Setup github and readme, get dataset and start developing frontend.

phase 2:
Coding part
wait for q2 and q3 what's the difference with and without pandas for data processing?
-	

Python script includes below functions:
-	dataProcessing function
-	analyzePatterns function
-	generatePredictions
-	results function


Just Finished troubleshooting "Upload csv button" it triggers dialog button.
Start phase 2, backend.
